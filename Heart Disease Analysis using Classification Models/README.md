# Heart Disease Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains code to analyze and predict the presence of heart disease using three different models:
1. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Polynomial Logistic Regression**

The analysis is based on the `Heart.csv` dataset, which includes various features related to heart health. The goal is to compare the performance of these models in predicting the presence of heart disease.

## Dataset

The `Heart.csv` dataset includes patient data with key columns such as:

- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **Chol**: Cholesterol level
- **MaxHR**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **AHD**: Presence of heart disease (1 for "Yes", 0 for "No")

## Data Preparation

- The response variable `AHD` is transformed into a binary indicator (1 for "Yes", 0 for "No").
- The dataset is split into training (75%) and validation (25%) sets.

## Models

### 1. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- **Model**: `KNeighborsClassifier`
- **Parameter**: `k=20`
- **Training**: The k-NN model is trained on the training set using **age** as the predictor.
- **Predictions**: Generate both classification and probability predictions for the training and validation data.
  
### 2. Logistic Regression
- **Model**: `LogisticRegression`
- **Parameter**: No regularization (`penalty=None`)
- **Training**: The logistic regression model is trained on the training set using **age** as the predictor.
- **Coefficients**: Extract and interpret the coefficients to understand the odds of having heart disease.

### 3. Polynomial Logistic Regression
- **Model**: `LogisticRegression` with polynomial features
- **Features**: Polynomial features of degree 3 are generated for **Chol** and **MaxHR**.
- **Training**: The model is trained on the training set using **Chol** and **MaxHR** as predictors.
- **Prediction**: Classify the presence of heart disease based on the polynomial model.

## Results

### 1. Predictions and Probabilities in Age Analysis

#### k-NN:
- Pure classifications and probability estimates are generated for both training and validation sets.

#### Logistic Regression:
- Coefficient estimates for the logistic regression model are obtained, and the estimated probability of having heart disease is computed for a 60-year-old.

### 2. Accuracy

The accuracy of both the **k-NN** and **Logistic Regression** models is computed and compared on both the training and validation sets. The **Polynomial Logistic Regression** model is also evaluated for accuracy on the training set.

### 3. Decision Boundary Visualization (Polynomial Logistic Regression)

The decision boundary of the **Polynomial Logistic Regression** model is visualized using a mesh grid. The plot shows how the model classifies data points based on the polynomial features of **Chol** and **MaxHR**.

### 4. Counterfactual and Sensitivity Analysis

A counterfactual analysis is performed for the **Polynomial Logistic Regression** model:
- Sensitivity to changes in **Chol** and **MaxHR** is analyzed by modifying each predictor by Â±0.5 standard deviations.
- The model is found to be more sensitive to changes in **MaxHR** compared to **Chol**.

## Visualization

### 1. k-NN and Logistic Regression Predictions
Plots are generated to visualize the observed data along with model predictions for both **k-NN** and **Logistic Regression**. The different types of predictions (classifications and probabilities) are shown.

### 2. Decision Boundary for Polynomial Logistic Regression
A decision boundary plot is created to visualize the polynomial logistic regression model's predictions. The boundary distinguishes between the predicted classes based on **Chol** and **MaxHR**.

### 3. Sensitivity Analysis Plot
A bar plot visualizes the number of changes in predictions caused by modifying **Chol** and **MaxHR**.

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates the application of three different models to predict heart disease based on the `Heart.csv` dataset:
- **k-NN** uses a non-parametric method to classify based on neighborhood voting.
- **Logistic Regression** estimates the odds and probability of heart disease based on linear predictors.
- **Polynomial Logistic Regression** extends logistic regression with polynomial features, capturing non-linear relationships between **Chol** and **MaxHR**.

Each model provides different insights into how heart disease is predicted, with varying levels of complexity and accuracy.
